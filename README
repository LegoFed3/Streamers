This is Streamers, the cross-platform streaming engine of the PeerStreamer p2p media streaming framework.

The Streamers code implements the application logic of a peer-to-peer
streaming engine, emphasizing simplicity, configurability and
variability. It forms the basis of the PeerStreamer application, but it
is written in a way to allow experimentation with a number of scheduling
and streaming protocols. Various branches of the Streamers repository
implement largely different streaming applications.

Dependencies
------------

Streamers requires the GRAPES library (http://peerstreamer.org/GRAPES)
in order to compile. Other libraries can be included to improve
functionality, but they are kept optional in order to allow research and
experimentation with the core streaming engine without the added
complexity of these components.

We recommend using the PeerStreamer build environment to get a
full-fledged version with all the bells and whistles. See
http://peerstreamer.org/content/development
